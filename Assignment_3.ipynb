    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "A. Functions reduces the duplicate code and also it makes the programs shorter,easier to read and update\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "A. Function runs when its called\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "A. def is a keyword used for creating the function\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "A. A function is a block of code that performs an operation and returns the result. A function call is the code used to pass control to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "A. There is only global scope in the entire program,The scope will remain till it gets terminated.\n",
    "   local scope is defined by the local variable in which it is defined in the function,Its scope remains only in that defined function,Likewise we can have any number of local scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "A. variables defined in a local scope remain in that function,when the function call returns,it retains the value and we can use any number of times calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "A. A return statement ends the function execution and returns the result,Yes we can return value in a expression when used explicitly.\n",
    "eg.return_42() + 5\n",
    "47\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "A. The function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "A. By using global keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "A. None defines null value or no value at all\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "A. It imports th module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "A. spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "A. By using simple checks\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "A. try and except clause are both used for catching and handling exceptions,Python executes the code in try block normally and in except block it checks for exceptions caused in preceeding try block.\n",
